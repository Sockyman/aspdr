# ASPDR
### The SPDR assembler.
This project is an assembler written for the [SPDR project](https://github.com/Sockyman/spdr-project).

ASPDR is the second SPDR assembler, the first being [SPAS](https://github.com/Sockyman/spas). This version is written in C++ and is much more maintainable than SPAS.
ASPDR uses a syntax similar to the Intel x86 syntax in anticipation of future upgrades to the CPU. SPAS on the other hand uses a syntax similar to 6502 assembly.

The assembler is in early development and there are many changes to come such as macros and conditional assembly.
